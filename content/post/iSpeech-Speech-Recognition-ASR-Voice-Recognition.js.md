## Goal
This SDK is designed to enable developers to interact with the Voice Recognition iSpeech API using Javascript.

## Implementation
The SDK uses `getUserMedia()` to record audio from the browser, encodes it to speex, then streams the data to the iSpeech API using a WebSocket.

## Completed
This project completed the stated goals.

## My contribution
I developed and maintained this project through its lifecycle, along with providing tech support where needed.
