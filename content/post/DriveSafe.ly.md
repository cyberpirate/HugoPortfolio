## Goal
The goal of this project was to help prevent people from driving dangerously by reading text messages to them and allowing them to respond with their voice.

## Implementation
The app uses the iSpeech api to recognize the user's voice and to speak any texts or emails the user receives.

## Completed
The app accomplishes the stated goals and is being maintained.

## My contribution
The app was written when I joined the team, I was responsible for updating it for new android versions and maintaining it, taking user feedback into account.
