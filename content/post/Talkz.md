## Goal
The goal of this project was to create an entertaining app where users can edit their voice to sound like a celebrity.

## Implementation
The app uses the Hats Off Api to stream audio to their servers, then play the processed results.

## Completed
The app accomplishes the stated goals and is being maintained.

## My contribution
I contributed to this app from it's creation, and helped maintain it through it's lifecycle.
