## Goal
The goal of this project was to create an open source Android SDK to help customers access the API quickly and easily.

## Implementation
For Speech Recognition the SDK uses the Android system to record WAV audio, converts it to [Speex](https://www.speex.org/), and streams that audio to the server in real time for recognition.

For Text to Speech the SDK accesses iSpeech's REST api and streams the audio.

## Completed
The SDK accomplishes the stated goals and is being maintained.

## My contribution
My contribution to this project was to maintain it through updates to the Android platform and fix any bugs customers found. I would also help with tech support if needed.
