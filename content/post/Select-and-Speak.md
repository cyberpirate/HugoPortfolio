## Goal
The goal of this project was to create a Chrome Extension that people could use to hear their webpages instead of just reading them.

## Implementation
The app uses the iSpeech api to stream audio generated from the text.

## Completed
The app accomplishes the stated goals and is being maintained.

## My contribution
The app was written when I joined the team, I was responsible for adding new features and maintaining it through it's lifecycle.
